          <p>
            Spring Health Care Limited, formerly known as Info Health Limited started operations in October 2009 in an office space for examinations and screening, located on the first floor of OT Plaza, Palmwine Junction- La, Accra Ghana. The staff strength at the time was three (3); the Director, a Retired Midwife, and an Administration Assistant. The main service rendered then centered on the creation of awareness of Cervical and Prostate cancer and screening for early detection and prevention.
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 2010, the organization acquired more office space in the same building and extended its services to include health talks to staff of organizations and institutions on cervical and prostate cancers and screening at their doorstep of interested clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2012, the name of the organization was changed to Spring Health Diagnostics Limited shortly after the commencement of external services. This was to make way for expansion, hence, the introduction of ultrasound scan services with the focus on Obstetric and Gynaecological scans to meet the increased demand for comprehensive Obstetric & Gynaecological Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to consistency in providing excellent and quality Obs. & Gynae. Services and the organization's vision to be a pacemaker in advanced Obs. & Gynae. ultrasound scans and consultancy, further expansion was seen in the area of high earned equipment base, skill mix staff, additional office space, and service portfolio. This resulted in the change of the name once again from Spring Health Diagnostics Limited to Spring Health Care Ltd. in 2018 to reflect the new vision of rendering care services beyond offering ultrasound scan services to women. The men's clinic and subsequently Medics 24/7 a virtual and home healthcare service to the cherished clientele was birth during this period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Spring Health Care Ltd. continues to offer great services and remains the health care provider that prioritises the care of its clients and their family with a staff strength that corresponds to the services offered.

            Dr. Francis Bitasimi Bilson founded Spring Health Care Limited formerly known as Info health in October 2009 with an initial vision to operate a private diagnostic centre and consultation to meet the growing needs of his cherished client.
